todo list:

 -nebulae no texture assigned issue

 -conditional MSAA

 -lighting based on visible sun fraction (debatable if this matters). seems
 important for getting rid of edge in sky during sunsets. can have a
 visibility factor function that replaces shadowing.

 -clean up remaining warnings

 -UI title size hierarchy. General UI tweaks.

 -reverse importance sample if looking at ground?

 -maybe investigate the top of sky circle bug if we feel like it

 -also maybe investigate AP rippling bug if we feel like it. But it's pretty
 inconsequential. Should be documented is all in known issues.

 -weird fog ap flicker bug? perhaps when sun is just right on horizon? can't
 seem to repro... bad state maybe?

new params:
  -possibly on hold but probably useful: nebula color gradients. is there a gradient ui parameter?
