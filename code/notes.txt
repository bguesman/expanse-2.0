todo list:
 -case out above atmosphere for ap/ss/ms. DONE except for AP.
 -nebulae no texture assigned issue
 -conditional MSAA
 -lighting based on visible sun fraction (debatable if this matters)
 -make night sky texture average evaluation more efficient
 -clean up remaining warnings
 -UI title size hierarchy
 -reverse importance sample if looking at ground?

 -maybe investigate the top of sky circle bug if we feel like it
 -also maybe investigate AP rippling bug if we feel like it

 -possibly split out atmo types into different arrays for perf? I don't know
 if this will help much but it may allow us to avoid branching in the shader
 in the inner loop. should see how much faster it is without the branch
 first.

new params:

  -possibly on hold but probably useful: nebula color gradients. is there a gradient ui parameter?
