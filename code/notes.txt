TODO LIST:
 -clean up remaining warnings


KNOWN BUGS:
  -nebulae no texture assigned

  -nebulae hole bug

  -weird fog ap flicker bug? perhaps when sun is just right on horizon? can't
  seem to repro... bad state maybe?
    -UPDATE: it appears that it has to do with the "depth" of the AP texture,
    not the horizontal or vertical resolution, and nothing to do with
    sampling the horizon line.
    -UPDATE: keeping tabs on this, but for now just going to limit the depth
    of the AP texture to 32.

  -top of sky circle bug if we feel like it

  -AP rippling bug


FUTURE FEATURE LIST:
  -clouds
  -volumetric shadowing for one body via directional light's cascaded shadow
  map
  -nebula color gradients. is there a gradient ui parameter?
  -lighting based on visible celestial body fraction
  -if anybody asks for it, enable/disable aerial perspective switch.
