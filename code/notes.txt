SKY
///////////////

TODO LIST:
  -overall ambient multiplier for cubemap
  -update nebulae to use perlin noise

KNOWN BUGS:
  -big stars that aren't affected by the size params
    -UPDATE: this is just a function of how the intensity feature works.
    This should be documented in whatever guide we have for the star
    feature.

  -weird fog ap flicker bug? perhaps when sun is just right on horizon? can't
  seem to repro... bad state maybe?
    -it's most visible as tiny flecks when we compute ap in realtime
    -it has to do with the transmittance table, because it's not visible when
    we compute transmittance without the table
    -hacked around by using max() call---see the code for details.

  -top of sky circle bug if we feel like it

  -AP rippling bug

  -AP heavy fog attenuation artifacts
    -more on this: for some reason if you make the fog super super dense
    for an analytical layer, and then dive down into it, you can sometimes
    see this huge circle artifact around the zenith of the sky.

  -Perlin noise grid size < 3 bug

  -super tiny seam in theta coordinate?


FUTURE FEATURE LIST:
  -clouds
  -volumetric shadowing for one body via directional light's cascaded shadow
  map
  -nebula color gradients. is there a gradient ui parameter?
  -lighting based on visible celestial body fraction
  -if anybody asks for it, enable/disable aerial perspective switch.
  -analytical integration for exponential and tent layers via polynomial
  approximation for realtime transmittance
  -analytical integration for attenuation bias
  -shadowing and eclipses for celestial bodies
    -in this vein, perhaps an acceleration structure on top? or maybe
    it's not slow enough to matter
    -maybe abstract out body occlusion queries to a function







///////////////
CLOUDS
///////////////

TODO LIST:
  -checkbox for bodies for if they affect clouds so that we can add bodies
  without them having to light the clouds and slow things down

  -To get to where we need to be:
    -performance needs to be significantly better
    -the compositing over direct light bug needs to be fixed
    -the multiple layers turns volumetric layers black bug needs to be fixed
    -generally, the compositing needs to look better I think. there's this weird
    bubble-looking thing around the clouds where transmittance isn't quite zero,
    but there's not enough in-scattering for there to be any noticeable light.
    it appears introducing depth probability makes it worse.

Parameters:
