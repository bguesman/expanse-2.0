todo list:
 -computeMSLayers and computeSSLayers sampling arguments. DONE.
 -case out above atmosphere for ap/ss/ms
 -nebulae no texture assigned issue
 -conditional MSAA
 -lighting based on visible sun fraction (debatable if this matters)
 -make night sky texture average evaluation more efficient
 -clean up remaining warnings
 -UI title size hierarchy
 -enable and disable lights depending on whether or not their corresponding
 body is enabled
 -moveable planet origin
 -transmittance lookup for direct lighting needs to be attenuated by
 analytical layers as well. DONE.
 -transmittance lookup needs to be done for directional lights too. DONE MINUS INTEGRAL SPLIT.
 -transmittance split integral for bias. NOTE: this doesn't actually seem to be that
 crucial to getting the look correct, and it's already expensive enough to evaluate
 the integral. I think I'm just gonna get rid of the attenuation bias in the UI.

 -maybe investigate the top of sky circle bug if we feel like it
 -also maybe investigate AP rippling bug if we feel like it

 -analytical solution for density attenuation. DONE.
 -add new atmosphere type for exponential fog and make it so density attenuation
 only works for that kind of atmo layer type. DONE.
 -allow specified point to attenuate density from, and checkbox for player origin. DONE.
 -possibly split out atmo types into different arrays for perf? I don't know
 if this will help much but it may allow us to avoid branching in the shader
 in the inner loop. should see how much faster it is without the branch
 first.

new params:
  -night scatter multiplier for AP => aerialPerspectiveNightScatteringMultiplier DONE.
  -AP samples (already set up but need to pass thru to shader). DONE.
  -checkbox for AP importance sampling => aerialPerspectiveUseImportanceSampling. DONE.
  -star tint parameter artistic override => starTint. DONE.
  -nebula seeds exposable in UI. DONE.
    -nebulaCoverageSeed
    -nebulaHazeSeedX
    -nebulaHazeSeedY
    -nebulaHazeSeedZ

    -nebulaTransmittanceSeedZ
  -AP depth non-linearity => aerialPerspectiveDepthSkew. DONE.

  -possibly on hold but probably useful: nebula color gradients. is there a gradient ui parameter?
