todo list:
 -clean up remaining warnings

known bugs:
  -nebulae no texture assigned
  -nebulae hole bug
  -weird fog ap flicker bug? perhaps when sun is just right on horizon? can't
  seem to repro... bad state maybe?
    -May want to put d.y hack back for aerial perspective.
    -Might also be fixed by putting a bigger threshold in ExpanseSkyMapping.hlsl.
    -UPDATE: neither of these fix it, but they do both change its behavior.
    -What's more is that I'm only seeing it appear on the higher resolution modes.
    Modes High->Ripping exhibit it, but Potato->Medium don't.
    A hack to fix it could be to just limit the resolution of the AP texture.
    -UPDATE: it appears that it has to do with the "depth" of the AP texture,
    not the horizontal or vertical resolution.
    -UPDATE: keeping tabs on this, but for now just going to limit the depth
    of the AP texture to 32.

  -top of sky circle bug if we feel like it

  -AP rippling bug

future feature list:
  -nebula color gradients. is there a gradient ui parameter?
  -lighting based on visible celestial body fraction
  -volumetric shadowing for one body via directional light's cascaded shadow
  map
  -if anybody asks for it, enable/disable aerial perspective switch.
