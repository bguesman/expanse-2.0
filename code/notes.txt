todo list:
 -conditional MSAA
 -lighting based on visible sun fraction (debatable if this matters). seems
 important for getting rid of edge in sky during sunsets. can have a
 visibility factor function that replaces shadowing.
  -this looks more complicated than it's worth right now. gonna leave the
  argument in the function but keep it as a stretch goal.
 -clean up remaining warnings
 -UI title size hierarchy. General UI tweaks.
 -reverse importance sample if looking at ground? edit: not important enough.
 -dithering

new params:
  -possibly on hold but probably useful: nebula color gradients. is there a gradient ui parameter?
  -date time lat/long position on planet (probably just want to specify it manually as
  a param)

known bugs:
  -nebulae no texture assigned
  -weird fog ap flicker bug? perhaps when sun is just right on horizon? can't
  seem to repro... bad state maybe?
  -top of sky circle bug if we feel like it
  -AP rippling bug.
